#Hello today I will be solving the problem of adding two numbers together.

#The problem is as follows:
num_1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num_2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

#The sum of the two numbers is calculated by adding the two numbers together.
sum = num_1 + num_2
print("The sum of the two numbers is: ", sum)

#The code above is a simple code that adds two numbers together.
#The code first asks the user to input two numbers. 
#The numbers are then added together and the sum is printed out.
#Also you can subtract, multiply, and divide the two numbers by changing the operator in the sum variable.
